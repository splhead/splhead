### Hi there 👋

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About </h3>

A person|dev trying to be better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today. I like to learn new things!

I've bachelor in System Analysis at Universidade Federal de Rondônia, I've worked with IT since 2009. I've developed and published a android app called "Meditação Cristã Adventista" that had 50000+ downloads at playstore in many countries of the world. The last project that I worked was a PWA app http://app.al.ro.gov.br this app has some tecnologies like graphql, NextJs, typescript, strapi and so on. I have others projects in nodeJs as backend and reactJs as front-end too. I did a telegram chat-bot as personal project also.

I'm participating a course called "Palomakoba" about mobile development, that course is a partnership beteween the Universidade Federal de Rondônia and Motorola.

I'm pos-graduated in Mobile development at Unyleya College.

- 💼 &nbsp; I'll be glad have a part-time job in your company. Tks
